# Dashboard Tabs - Looker Extension

Transform your Looker experience with a powerful tabbed dashboard interface. This extension enables seamless switching between multiple dashboards while preserving filters, context, and navigation state. Perfect for users who need to work across multiple dashboards simultaneously. Supports folder, board, and adhoc dashboard navigation, plus printing functionality, but is configurable to turn off any of these features. It also supports *global filters*. As long as your dashboard filters share the same name, they will be applied to all dashboards in the tabbed interface.

## ðŸš€ Quick Start

Have a LookML Developer or Admin add this configuration to any of your projects' `manifest.lkml` files, refresh the page, then navigate to **Applications > Dashboard Tabs**.

```lookml
application: dashboard_tabs {
  label: "Dashboard Tabs"
  url: "https://cdn.lkr.dev/apps/dashboard-tabs/latest/bundle.js"
  entitlements: {
    core_api_methods: [
      "me", 
      "dashboard", 
      "search_dashboards", 
      "folder_dashboards", 
      "board", 
      "search_boards", 
      "folder", 
      "search_folders",
      "create_board",
      "create_board_section",
      "create_board_item",
      "create_content_favorite"
    ]
    navigation: yes
    use_embeds: yes
    use_iframes: yes
    new_window: yes
    use_form_submit: yes
  }
}
```

Now go to settings and open a board, a folder, switch to adhoc dashboards or add default dashboards. For global filters to work, make sure the filters on each dashboard have the same name. For example if they have a "Date" filter, then navigating between the dashboards will pass the "Date" filter value to each dashboard.

You can use this extnension multiple times with different configuration options by adding multiple applications to your manifest.lkml file.

## Development

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (20 or higher, see [.nvmrc](.nvmrc) for the exact version)
- npm package manager
- Looker instance with extension framework enabled

### **Build Commands**

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Development servers
npm run dev:https    # HTTPS (recommended for Looker)
npm run dev          # HTTP (for development with tunnels like cloudflared)

# Production build
npm run build
```

### **Local Development Configuration**

For local development, use this manifest configuration:

```lookml
application: dashboard_tabs {
  label: "Dashboard Tabs"
  url: "https://localhost:8080/bundle.js"
  entitlements: {
    core_api_methods: [
      "me", 
      "dashboard", 
      "search_dashboards", 
      "folder_dashboards", 
      "board", 
      "search_boards", 
      "folder", 
      "search_folders",
      "create_board",
      "create_board_section",
      "create_board_item",
      "create_content_favorite"
    ]
    navigation: yes
    use_embeds: yes
    use_iframes: yes
    new_window: yes
    use_form_submit: yes
  }
  mount_points: {
    standalone: yes
  }
}
```

**Note**: For local development without CDN access, run `npm run build` to generate a `bundle.js` file in the `dist` directory. Drag this file to your Looker project in dev mode and use `file: "bundle.js"` in the manifest instead of `url`.
