# Dashboard Tabs - Looker Extension

Transform your Looker experience with a powerful tabbed dashboard interface. This extension enables seamless switching between multiple dashboards while preserving filters, context, and navigation state. Perfect for users who need to work across multiple dashboards simultaneously. Supports folder, board, and adhoc dashboard navigation, plus printing functionality, but is configurable to turn off any of these features. It also supports *global filters*. As long as your dashboard filters share the same name, they will be applied to all dashboards in the tabbed interface.

## üîß Development

### **Prerequisites**
- Node.js (v18 or higher)
- npm package manager
- Looker instance with extension framework enabled

### **Build Commands**

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Development servers
npm run dev:https    # HTTPS (recommended for Looker)
npm run dev          # HTTP (for development with tunnels like cloudflared)

# Production build
npm run build
```

### **Local Development Configuration**

For local development, use this manifest configuration:

```lookml
application: dashboard_tabs {
  label: "Dashboard Tabs"
  url: "https://localhost:8080/bundle.js"
  entitlements: {
    core_api_methods: [
      "me",
